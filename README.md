# üéôÔ∏è He Said, She Said: A Gendered Twist on Virtual Assistants

This project explores how voice-based virtual assistants can be enhanced using machine learning models that adapt responses based on a speaker‚Äôs gender. It aims to promote more **empathetic**, **personalized**, and **ethically aware** AI interactions.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

Current virtual assistants operate on a one-size-fits-all paradigm, often missing personalization cues that could improve engagement and user satisfaction. Our project leverages audio-based features to classify gender and proposes using this signal to create more relatable virtual assistant interactions.

## üí° Project Highlights

- **Goal**: Build a gender-sensitive voice classifier to tailor virtual assistant interactions
- **Impact**: Unlocks potential for AI systems that consider user context like gender, emotion, culture
- **Dataset**: Vocal Gender Features Dataset (10,380 audio samples, ~5768 valid instances)

---

## üîç Feature Engineering

- **Feature Types**: Spectral, Pitch, Energy, Frequency, Complexity
- **Feature Selection**: 
  - Removed highly correlated features (threshold > 0.9)
  - Top 20 features chosen via Random Forest and Decision Tree importance scores
  - Final 12 features selected using Recursive Feature Elimination + domain expertise

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Pipeline

- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Train-Test split (70-30)
  - Standardization using `StandardScaler`
  - Class balancing via **SMOTE**
  
- **Models Evaluated**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
  - LSTM
  - CNN

- **Best Performer**: **SVM** (98% accuracy, highest macro precision/recall)

## üöß Limitations & Next Steps

| Limitation                        | Mitigation Strategy                                      |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Binary gender classification     | Explore non-binary or spectrum-based models              |
| Accent/noise sensitivity         | Augment dataset with diverse accents and conditions      |
| Male-heavy dataset               | Improve class balance through more inclusive sampling    |
